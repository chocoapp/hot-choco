# Hot Choco - User Flow Quality Visualization

A Next.js application that visualizes user flows with integrated quality metrics and risk assessment. This tool displays interactive flow diagrams where each screen is mapped to product documentation, test results, and bug reports to create a comprehensive quality/risk heatmap.

## Features

- **Interactive Flow Visualization**: React Flow-based diagrams showing user journey screens
- **Quality Metrics Integration**: Real-time display of test coverage, bug counts, and risk levels
- **Risk-Based Color Coding**: Visual heatmap using green/yellow/red color scheme
- **Product Hierarchy Mapping**: Structured product/section/feature organization
- **Extensible Architecture**: Ready for Supabase vector DB and Allure TestOps integration

## Architecture Overview

â””â”€â”€ public/
    â””â”€â”€ flow.json                # Flow data with quality metrics
```

### Data Structure

Each screen node contains:
- **Screen metadata**: Label, URL, role, description, actions, prerequisites
- **Product hierarchy**: Product, section, feature mapping
- **Quality metrics**: Test coverage, bug count, risk level, test results

### Service Architecture

- **SupabaseService**: Vector DB integration for product documentation and bug reports
- **AllureService**: TestOps integration for test execution data and coverage metrics
- **QualityService**: Aggregates data from both services to calculate risk levels

## Risk Level Calculation

The risk level is calculated using a weighted scoring system in `QualityServiceImpl.calculateRiskLevel()`:

### Scoring Components:
1. **Test Coverage (40% weight):**
   - < 60% coverage: +40 risk points
   - 60-79% coverage: +20 risk points  
   - â‰¥ 80% coverage: +0 risk points

2. **Bug Count (60% weight):**
   - 0 bugs: +0 risk points
   - 1-2 bugs: +20 risk points
   - 3-5 bugs: +40 risk points
   - 6+ bugs: +60 risk points

### Risk Level Classification:
- **â‰¤ 20 points**: ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**
- **21-50 points**: ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**  
- **51+ points**: ðŸ”´ **High Risk**

### Example Calculations:

**Phone Login (Medium Risk):**
- Test coverage: 85% â†’ 0 points
- Bug count: 2 â†’ 20 points
- **Total: 20 points = Medium Risk**

**Order Guide (High Risk):**
- Test coverage: 72% â†’ 20 points
- Bug count: 3 â†’ 40 points
- **Total: 60 points = High Risk**

**Inbox (Low Risk):**
- Test coverage: 95% â†’ 0 points
- Bug count: 0 â†’ 0 points
- **Total: 0 points = Low Risk**

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Completed Tasks
1. **Extended FlowNodeData type** with product/section/feature hierarchy
2. **Mapped existing screens** to product/section/feature structure
3. **Created data integration service interfaces** for Supabase and Allure
4. **Updated flow.json** with new hierarchical structure and quality metrics
5. **Enhanced NodeDetailsPanel** to show quality metrics and product hierarchy
6. **Added risk-based color coding** to flow visualization nodes
7. **Tested application** and verified all features work with mock data

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps
- Connect real Supabase vector DB for product documentation
- Integrate with Allure TestOps for live test data
- Add real-time quality metrics updates
- Implement filtering by risk level, product, or coverage
- Create aggregate quality dashboards and reports

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ with npm or pnpm
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open the application:**
- **Primary interface**: [http://localhost:3000/graph](http://localhost:3000/graph)
- Main page: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The app runs with **Turbopack** for fast development builds and hot reloading.

## Key Features & Usage

### Interactive Flow Visualization
- **Main interface**: Navigate to `/graph` for the interactive flow diagram
- **Risk-based color coding**: Nodes are colored by risk level (ðŸŸ¢ Low, ðŸŸ¡ Medium, ðŸ”´ High)
- **Node details**: Click any node to see detailed information in the side panel
- **Filtering**: Use "Show Filters" to filter by product, section, or risk level
- **Navigation**: Minimap and zoom controls for easy navigation

### Quality Metrics Dashboard
Each screen displays:
- **Test Coverage**: Progress bar showing percentage of tests passing
- **Bug Count**: Badge showing number of open bugs
- **Risk Level**: Color-coded badge (Low/Medium/High)
- **Test Results**: Breakdown of passed/failed/skipped tests

### Product Hierarchy Structure
Screens are organized by:
- **Product**: High-level product area (e.g., "authentication", "ordering-system")
- **Section**: Functional section (e.g., "login", "checkout", "catalog")
- **Feature**: Specific feature (e.g., "phone-login", "product-browsing")

This enables direct mapping to documentation, tests, and bug reports in external systems.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Visualization**: React Flow, Dagre (auto-layout)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data Sources**: Supabase (vector DB), Allure TestOps
- **Build**: Turbopack

## Important Implementation Details

### Data Structure
- Flow data is stored in `public/flow.json` with complete node/edge definitions
- Each node contains screen metadata, quality metrics, and product hierarchy
- Live integration with Supabase vector DB and Allure TestOps APIs
- Fallback mock data available in `public/` for development

### Current State
- âœ… **Fully functional** with live Supabase and Allure TestOps integration
- âœ… **Risk calculation** algorithm implemented (`services/qualityService.ts:68`)
- âœ… **Interactive filtering** by product, section, and risk level
- âœ… **Auto-layout** using Dagre algorithm for optimal node positioning
- âœ… **Production ready** with real-time quality metrics

### Development Guidelines
**Always verify before committing:**
```bash
npm run build    # Ensure production build succeeds
npm run lint     # Check for linting errors
```
- Check TypeScript errors in IDE or run `tsc --noEmit`
- Test the main `/graph` interface functionality
- Verify Supabase and Allure TestOps connections are working
