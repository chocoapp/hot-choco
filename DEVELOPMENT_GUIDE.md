# Development & Troubleshooting Guide

This guide documents key learnings from debugging and developing the Hot Choco risk heatmap application.

## Key Architecture Learnings

### 1. **Data Flow & Risk Calculation**
- **Real Data Sources**: Only bug data from Supabase and test count from Allure TestOps are available
- **No Test Execution Data**: Test coverage percentages and pass/fail results are mocked - avoid using them
- **Feature vs Screen**: Risk is calculated at the **feature level**, not screen level
- **Multiple Screens per Feature**: One feature can have multiple screens (e.g., `feature_checkout_order_submission` has Shopping Cart, Checkout, and Confirmation screens)

### 2. **React Key Management**
- **Critical Issue**: Using feature names as React keys causes "duplicate key" errors when multiple screens share the same feature
- **Solution**: Use unique node IDs or feature-level grouping with unique keys
- **Example**: `key={item.featureId}` instead of `key={item.feature}`

### 3. **Data Structure Rules**
- **Never modify feature names** in `flow.json` - they're fixed and map to real data sources
- **Feature grouping**: Multiple screens can legitimately belong to the same feature
- **Risk calculation**: Group screens by feature, then calculate risk per feature

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 20+ (use `nvm use 20`)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (faster and more reliable than npm)
- **Browser Testing**: Playwright with MCP for automated testing

### Setup Steps
```bash
# 1. Switch to Node 20
nvm use 20

# 2. Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm

# 3. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 4. Start development server
pnpm dev
```

**Note**: No need to install Playwright locally - use the Playwright MCP server for testing!

## Debugging Methodology

### 1. **Server Connection Issues**
**Problem**: "This site can't be reached" errors

**Debugging Steps**:
1. **Check if server is running**: `ps aux | grep "next dev"`
2. **Check port listening**: `netstat -an | grep :3000`
3. **Test with curl**: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000`
4. **Use Playwright MCP**: Automated browser testing to verify actual functionality

**Common Solutions**:
- Kill existing processes: `pkill -f "next dev"`
- Try different port: `pnpm dev -- --port 3001`
- Check firewall/VPN settings
- Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`

### 2. **Playwright MCP Issues**
**Problem**: Browser executable not found

**Root Cause**: Version mismatch between MCP server and installed browsers

**Solutions**:

**Option 1: Use MCP Server Only (Recommended)**
- Don't install Playwright locally
- Rely on the MCP server for all browser testing
- MCP server handles browser management automatically

**Option 2: Fix Version Compatibility (If needed)**
```bash
# Only if you need local Playwright for some reason
pnpm add @playwright/test
npx playwright install

# Fix version compatibility if needed
ln -sf /path/to/chromium-actual /path/to/chromium-expected
```

**Best Practice**: Use the MCP server for testing - it's cleaner and avoids version conflicts!

### 3. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
**Problem**: Property doesn't exist on type errors

**Debugging Steps**:
1. **Run TypeScript check**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. **Check types**: Ensure interface definitions match actual data
3. **Update types**: Remove mocked properties that don't exist in real data

### 4. **React Runtime Errors**
**Problem**: Duplicate keys, component crashes

**Debugging Steps**:
1. **Check browser console**: F12 ‚Üí Console for detailed error messages
2. **Verify data structure**: Ensure keys are unique across all items
3. **Test with simplified data**: Isolate the problematic component

## Testing Strategy

### 1. **Build Verification**
```bash
# Always test build before deployment
pnpm build

# Check for linting issues
pnpm lint

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 2. **Automated Browser Testing**
Using Playwright MCP for comprehensive testing:

**MCP Commands for Testing**:
```bash
# Navigate to page
mcp__playwright__playwright_navigate(url: "http://localhost:3000/graph")

# Take screenshot
mcp__playwright__playwright_screenshot(name: "graph-page", savePng: true)

# Click elements
mcp__playwright__playwright_click(selector: 'button:has-text("Risk Overview")')

# Test interactions
mcp__playwright__playwright_click(selector: 'button:has-text("View Details")')
```

**MCP Testing Workflow**:
1. **Start server**: `pnpm dev`
2. **Navigate**: Use MCP to open pages
3. **Interact**: Click buttons, fill forms
4. **Verify**: Take screenshots, check content
5. **Debug**: Use console logs and visual verification

**Advantages of MCP Testing**:
- ‚úÖ No local Playwright installation needed
- ‚úÖ No version conflicts
- ‚úÖ Visual verification with screenshots
- ‚úÖ Real browser environment
- ‚úÖ No test setup configuration required

### 3. **Component Testing**
- **Test with real data**: Don't rely on mocked data for final verification
- **Test edge cases**: Empty data, no bugs, no tests
- **Test grouping logic**: Verify features with multiple screens work correctly

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. **Don't Modify Fixed Data**
‚ùå **Wrong**: Changing feature names in `flow.json` to fix React keys
‚úÖ **Right**: Use proper key management in components

### 2. **Understand Real vs Mocked Data**
‚ùå **Wrong**: Building features based on mocked test execution data
‚úÖ **Right**: Only use real data sources (Supabase bugs, Allure test count)

### 3. **Feature vs Screen Confusion**
‚ùå **Wrong**: Calculating risk per screen
‚úÖ **Right**: Group screens by feature, calculate risk per feature

### 4. **Dependency Management**
‚ùå **Wrong**: Using npm with Node 18
‚úÖ **Right**: Use pnpm with Node 20 for better performance and compatibility

## Risk Calculation Formula

### Enhanced Algorithm (Real Data Only)
```typescript
// Risk Score = Bug Risk (70%) + Test Coverage Risk (30%)
riskScore = (bugRiskScore * 0.7) + (testCoverageRisk * 0.3)

// Bug Risk Score
bugVolumeScore = Math.min(openBugCount * 3, 30) // Capped at 30
severityScore = sum of:
  - Critical bugs: 20 points each
  - High bugs: 12 points each  
  - Medium bugs: 6 points each
  - Low bugs: 2 points each

// Test Coverage Risk (inverse relationship)
testCoverageRisk = 
  - 0 tests: 30 points
  - 1-5 tests: 20 points
  - 6-10 tests: 10 points
  - 11+ tests: 0 points
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. **Build Time**
- Use Turbopack: `next dev --turbopack`
- Optimize dependencies: Use pnpm for faster installs
- Node 20: Better performance than 18

### 2. **Runtime Performance**
- Group data processing: Don't recalculate risk for each render
- Use proper React keys: Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy load heavy components: Use React.lazy for modals
